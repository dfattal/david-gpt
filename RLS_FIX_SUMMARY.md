# RLS DELETE Conversation Fix - Complete Analysis & Solution

## Issue Summary
**Critical Bug**: DELETE conversation functionality fails with RLS policy violation
**Error Code**: 42501 - "new row violates row-level security policy for table 'conversations'"
**Impact**: Users cannot delete conversations, causing 500 errors and broken UI

## Root Cause Analysis

The DELETE API endpoint at `/api/conversations/[id]` performs a **soft delete** by setting the `deleted_at` field:

```typescript
// From src/app/api/conversations/[id]/route.ts line 70
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('conversations')
  .update({ deleted_at: new Date().toISOString() })  // This is an UPDATE, not DELETE
  .eq('id', id)
```

However, the RLS policy `conv_update_owner` was missing the required `with check` clause:

```sql
-- BROKEN POLICY (original)
create policy conv_update_owner
on public.conversations for update
using (owner = auth.uid());  -- Missing "with check" clause!
```

For UPDATE operations in PostgreSQL RLS, you need:
1. `using` clause - determines which rows can be selected for update
2. `with check` clause - validates that updated rows still meet security conditions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed RLS Policy
Updated the policy in `sql/001_init.sql` and `db.md` contract:

```sql
-- FIXED POLICY
create policy conv_update_owner
on public.conversations for update
using (owner = auth.uid())
with check (owner = auth.uid());  -- Added required with check clause
```

### 2. Database Migration
Created `sql/002_fix_delete_conversation_rls.sql` with the fix that can be applied via Supabase dashboard.

### 3. Test Infrastructure
Created comprehensive testing:
- `test-delete-conversation.js` - Node.js test script
- `src/app/test-delete/page.tsx` - Browser-based test page at `/test-delete`
- `MANUAL_DB_FIX.md` - Step-by-step fix instructions

## Files Modified

✅ **Core Fix**:
- `sql/001_init.sql` - Fixed RLS policy with `with check` clause
- `.claude/contracts/db.md` - Updated contract to reflect fix

✅ **Migration & Testing**:
- `sql/002_fix_delete_conversation_rls.sql` - Database migration script
- `test-delete-conversation.js` - Comprehensive test script
- `src/app/test-delete/page.tsx` - Browser-based test page

✅ **Documentation**:
- `MANUAL_DB_FIX.md` - Manual fix instructions
- `RLS_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This comprehensive analysis
- `.claude/master_plan.md` - Progress tracking updated

## How to Apply the Fix

### Method 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard → Your Project
2. SQL Editor → New Query
3. Run the migration from `sql/002_fix_delete_conversation_rls.sql`
4. Verify with the test page at `http://localhost:3000/test-delete`

### Method 2: Command Line (If Available)
```bash
# Apply via Supabase CLI (requires proper auth)
supabase db push --file sql/002_fix_delete_conversation_rls.sql
```

## Testing the Fix

### Browser Test (Recommended)
1. Ensure you're logged in to the app
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/test-delete`
3. Click "Test DELETE Conversation"
4. Should see all green checkmarks if fix is applied

### Expected Results After Fix:
- ✅ CREATE conversation: Success
- ✅ VERIFY exists in list: Success
- ✅ DELETE conversation: Success (200 response, not 500)
- ✅ VERIFY hidden from list: Success

## Security Validation

The fix maintains proper security:
- ✅ Users can only update/delete their own conversations (`owner = auth.uid()`)
- ✅ Soft deleted conversations are hidden from SELECT queries (`deleted_at is null`)
- ✅ RLS policies prevent cross-user access
- ✅ Both `using` and `with check` clauses enforce ownership

## Success Criteria

- ✅ No more 42501 RLS policy violation errors
- ✅ DELETE API returns 200 status instead of 500
- ✅ Deleted conversations disappear from sidebar immediately
- ✅ Users can successfully delete their own conversations
- ✅ RLS still prevents users from deleting other users' conversations
- ✅ Browser test page shows all green results

**Status**: Fix implemented and ready for database deployment
**Next Step**: Apply the database migration via Supabase dashboard
**Ticket**: FIX-DELETE-CONVERSATION-RLS (backend-developer)
**Priority**: Critical - Blocking conversation management functionality
