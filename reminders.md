# Reminders

- Evaluate getting rid of superfluous persona defined RAG thresholds since they are not used ?
- Are we using persona.config.json anywhere ? if not can we get rid of it ? If yes, how is related to persona.md and to the RAG response ?
- Admin function to ADD persona (via uploading persona.md -- maybe without the thresholds)
