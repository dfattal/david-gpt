- many documents have junk titles, check if they are meant to be real documents or the result of a malformed insertion query
- patents missing expiration date
- is RAG retrieval explicitly using metadata such as patent authors or article publication date ? This metadata I believe is all contained in a searchable chunk so could be accessed from there ?
