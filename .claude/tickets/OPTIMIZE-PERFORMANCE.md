# OPTIMIZE-PERFORMANCE

**Agent**: performance-engineer  
**Priority**: P1 (High)  
**Status**: todo

## Problem Statement
Severe performance issues during streaming chat:
- Components re-rendering 450+ times during single streaming response
- Excessive render cycles will impact battery life and user experience
- Performance budget violations detected during testing

## Root Cause Analysis Required
1. **Component Re-renders**: Identify components causing excessive renders
2. **State Management**: Review React state updates during streaming
3. **Optimization Opportunities**: Identify memo/callback opportunities
4. **Streaming Optimization**: Review streaming response handling

## Expected Deliverables
- [ ] Analyze component render patterns during streaming
- [ ] Implement React.memo for appropriate components
- [ ] Add useCallback/useMemo where needed
- [ ] Optimize streaming response state updates
- [ ] Reduce render frequency during token-by-token display
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring improvements
- [ ] Test performance improvements with Playwright
- [ ] Document performance optimizations

## Performance Targets
- Reduce component renders by 80% during streaming
- Maintain first token latency under 200ms budget
- Keep render frequency under 10 renders per second
- Ensure smooth streaming animation

## Technical Focus Areas
- MessageInput component (400+ renders observed)
- VirtualMessageList component rendering
- ChatInterface state management
- Streaming token display optimization

## Definition of Done
- Component render count reduced significantly during streaming
- Smooth streaming performance maintained
- Performance budgets met during testing
- User experience improved on mobile devices

## Dependencies
- Core chat functionality (working)

## Time Estimate
3-4 hours
