# Master Plan: ChatGPT-style App (Next.js + Vercel AI SDK v5 + Supabase + shadcn)

## Scope
- Realtime streaming chat
- Supabase Auth + RLS
- Persisted messages (user + assistant)
- Smart auto titles; rename/delete conversations
- FUTURE (not MVP): RAG using vectorized DB on supabase

## Contract Status
- [x] `api.md` - API endpoints and contracts
- [x] `db.md` - Database schema and RLS policies  
- [x] `events.md` - Event types and data flow
- [ ] All contracts frozen with timestamps

## Milestones
- [x] M1 Contracts Frozen (DB v1, API v1, Events v1)
- [x] M2 Database Schema Implemented
- [x] M3 Backend API Streaming
- [x] M4 Frontend UI & State Management
- [x] M5 Authentication Integration
- [x] M6 Title Generation
- [x] M7 QA E2E Tests
- [x] M8 Performance Optimization
- [ ] M9 Production Deployment
