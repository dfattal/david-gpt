Neural Networks and Machine Learning

Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes called neurons. Deep learning uses multi-layer neural networks to process complex data patterns.

Companies like OpenAI and Google have developed transformer architectures for natural language processing. The transformer model revolutionized AI with its attention mechanism.

Key researchers in this field include Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, and Yann LeCun. These pioneers developed foundational algorithms for deep learning.

Modern applications include:
- Computer vision for image recognition
- Natural language processing for text analysis
- Reinforcement learning for game playing

The field continues to evolve with new architectures and training techniques emerging regularly.
