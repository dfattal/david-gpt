## Abstract

A multi-view display is switchable between a single view mode and a multi-view mode. It utilizes lenticular means arranged over a display panel, which comprise a birefringent electro-optic material adjacent to a non-switchable, optically transparent layer. The non-switchable layer has a refractive index substantially equal to the extra-ordinary refractive index of the birefringent electro-optic material.

In the single view mode, the birefringent electro-optic material is in a non-switched state. The polarization of the light output from the display panel is linear and aligned with the optical axis of the birefringent material at the receiving surface. This configuration effectively cancels the lensing effect, allowing for a full-resolution 2D image.

In the multi-view mode, the birefringent electro-optic material enters a switched state. In this state, its optical axis is aligned perpendicularly to the display output surface. This re-engages the lenticular lenses, directing different images to different spatial locations to create a stereoscopic or multi-view effect.

## Background

There are two primary types of multi-view display devices. The first type presents different images to viewers at different spatial locations, such as in a vehicle where a driver sees navigation while a passenger sees entertainment content. The second type is autostereoscopic displays, which project different views to each eye of a viewer to create a 3D effect. These may offer two views for a single viewer or many views (e.g., 9 or 15) to support multiple viewers or provide a "look around" effect. The underlying principle for both types is the simultaneous projection of different 2D content to distinct spatial locations.

A known autostereoscopic display consists of a two-dimensional liquid crystal display (LCD) panel with a row and column array of pixels. An array of elongate lenticular elements, typically semi-cylindrical lenses, is placed over the pixel array. Each lenticular element overlies a group of two or more columns of pixels, directing the light from each column to a different viewing angle. This allows a user's left and right eyes to see different images, creating a single stereoscopic view.

However, to provide these stereoscopic views, the horizontal resolution of the display must be sacrificed. This reduction in resolution is unacceptable for applications requiring the display of fine details, such as small text or high-resolution graphics. To address this, switchable autostereoscopic displays have been proposed, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,069,650. These devices can operate in a 2D mode, where the lenticular elements act as a transparent "pass-through" sheet, or a 3D mode, where they direct light to create stereoscopic images. The switching is achieved by using an electro-optic material (like liquid crystal) for the lenses, whose refractive index can be altered by applying an electrical potential, thereby enabling or disabling the refracting effect.

## Summary

This invention addresses the problem of unwanted display artefacts, such as visible banding or shading, that appear in the 2D mode of switchable multi-view displays, particularly when viewed at oblique angles. These artefacts are believed to be caused by a residual lens effect stemming from the birefringent properties of the liquid crystal material used in the switchable lenses.

The proposed solution is a display device featuring a switchable birefringent electro-optic material and a non-switchable, optically transparent layer. The non-switchable layer has a refractive index that is substantially equal to the extra-ordinary refractive index of the birefringent material. In the single-view (2D) mode, the device aligns the linear polarization of the incident light with the optical axis of the birefringent material. This alignment ensures a perfect index match, eliminating the residual lens effect and the associated visual artefacts for a high-quality 2D image, especially in the horizontal viewing plane.

In the multi-view (3D) mode, the birefringent material's optical axis is aligned perpendicularly to the display surface (homeotropically aligned), creating a refractive index mismatch that enables the lenticular lensing function. The electro-optic material preferably comprises a twisted nematic liquid crystal, which can provide a polarization twist to match the output polarization of various display panel types (e.g., LCD, OLED) to the desired orientation at the lens interface. This design avoids the complexity of using a birefringent replica structure and provides a high-quality single-view mode free of image artefacts.

## Detailed Description

### Device Architecture and Operation

As shown in FIG. 1, a known switchable autostereoscopic display device 1 comprises a liquid crystal display panel 3 with an orthogonal array of pixels 5. A light source 7, such as a planar backlight, illuminates the panel. Overlying the display panel is a lenticular element arrangement 9, which contains an array of lenticular elements 11 that can be controlled to perform a view-forming function.

FIG. 2 provides a detailed view of the lenticular arrangement 9. It consists of a pair of transparent glass substrates 13, 15, coated with transparent electrode layers 17, 19 made of indium tin oxide (ITO). Between these substrates lies an optically transparent layer 21 with an inverse lenticular structure, and a nematic liquid crystal (LC) material 23. The inverse structure of layer 21 causes the LC material 23 to form parallel, elongate semi-cylindrical lenticular shapes. Orientation layers 25 and 26 are used to align the liquid crystal material.

By applying an electrical potential across the electrodes 17, 19, an electric field is generated across the LC material 23. Due to its dielectric anisotropy, the orientation of the LC molecules can be controlled. This, in turn, changes the effective refractive index of the lenticular elements.

### 3D and 2D Mode Switching

FIG. 3A illustrates the 3D mode, where no electric potential is applied. The LC molecules are aligned by the orientation layers 25 and 26. In this state, the refractive index of the LC material 23 is substantially higher than that of the lenticular body 21. The lenticular shapes thus provide a light output directing function, acting as convex cylindrical lenses to provide different views from the display panel to the user's eyes, creating a 3D image.

FIG. 3B illustrates the 2D mode, where an alternating electric potential is applied. The electric field aligns the LC molecules perpendicular to the display plane. In this orientation, the effective refractive index of the LC material 23 for the polarized light from the display panel substantially matches the index of the lenticular body 21. With the indices matched, the light output directing function is cancelled, and the array effectively acts as a transparent "pass-through" sheet, enabling a high-resolution 2D image.

### The Problem of 2D Artefacts

While the 2D mode works well for direct, orthogonal viewing, undesirable artefacts appear at oblique viewing angles. As illustrated in FIG. 4, for oblique light rays, the effective refractive index of the LC material 23 is not equal to its ordinary index due to its birefringent properties. This mismatch causes residual refraction at the curved lens surface, creating a lens effect that is dependent on the viewing angle. At certain angles, this effect can cause the black matrix between pixels to be imaged at infinity, resulting in visible dark banding related to the lenticular array structure. This issue can be mitigated by using a birefringent material for the lenticular body 21 that matches both the ordinary and extra-ordinary indices of the LC material, as shown in FIG. 5, but this adds complexity.

### The Inventive Solution

FIGS. 6A and 6B show the configuration according to the invention. The display includes a display panel 66, a switchable liquid crystal (LC) cell 62, and an isotropic, non-switchable lenticular layer 60. The refractive index (n) of the isotropic lenticular 60 is matched to the extra-ordinary refractive index of the LC 62.

In the 2D mode (FIG. 6A), the LC material is in a non-switched, planar aligned state. The polarization 64 of the display output is rotated by the LC (if necessary, using a twisted nematic cell) so that at the lens interface, its orientation is parallel to the optical axis of the LC molecules. This creates a perfect index match, and the light passes through without refraction, eliminating artefacts in the primary viewing plane.

In the 3D mode (FIG. 6B), the LC 62 is switched into a homeotropically aligned state. The light now experiences the ordinary refractive index of the LC, creating a refractive index mismatch at the lens interface. This activates the lensing function required for multi-view operation. By prioritizing the non-switched state for the 2D mode, which consumers are most familiar with, a higher quality viewing experience is achieved with less residual lens action and fewer artefacts. A polarizer 70 (FIG. 7) can be added between the display output and the lenticular arrangement to make the system compatible with various display types like OLED or plasma.
