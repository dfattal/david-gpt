## Abstract

An autostereoscopic display device is disclosed that includes a display panel with an array of pixels for producing a display, and a parallax generating element for directing different images to a viewer's left and right eyes. The parallax generating element has a non-uniform refractive power, which is adapted to reduce optical distortion that would otherwise be visible to a viewer of the display. This non-uniformity is particularly designed to counteract distortions arising from the arrangement of sub-pixels and the black matrix within the display panel. By tailoring the refractive properties of the parallax element, the device can project views with reduced deformation, thereby improving the quality of the 3D image and mitigating undesirable artifacts such as the Moiré effect.

## Background

Autostereoscopic display devices provide a three-dimensional (3D) viewing experience without the need for special glasses. These devices work by projecting slightly different images to each of the viewer's eyes, which the brain then combines to perceive depth. A common method for achieving this is to use a parallax generating element, such as a lenticular sheet, placed in front of a standard display panel like an LCD. The lenticular sheet consists of an array of cylindrical lenses (lenticules) that refract light from the display's pixels in different directions.

The pixels of the display panel are typically arranged in a regular grid. Each pixel is composed of sub-pixels, usually red, green, and blue, which emit light to form a color image. The parallax generating element is aligned with the pixel array so that light from different sub-pixels is directed towards different viewing zones, or "views," in front of the display. A viewer perceives a 3D image when their left and right eyes are positioned in different viewing zones.

A significant challenge in the design of these displays is optical distortion. The discrete nature of the pixel grid and the presence of a non-emissive "black matrix" between sub-pixels can interfere with the light paths created by the parallax element. This can lead to artifacts such as Moiré patterns, which are interference patterns that appear when two grids are overlaid at an angle or with slightly different mesh sizes. Furthermore, the optical system can introduce geometric distortions, causing straight lines in the intended image to appear curved or warped to the viewer. These distortions degrade the quality of the 3D effect and can cause viewer discomfort. Prior art solutions have often focused on uniform lenticular designs, which do not adequately address the complex distortions arising from the sub-pixel structure.

## Summary

The invention provides an autostereoscopic display device with improved image quality by using a parallax generating element with a non-uniform refractive power. This non-uniformity is specifically designed to correct for optical distortions that are inherent in displays with a regular grid of sub-pixels and a black matrix. The core innovation is the recognition that a uniform parallax element fails to account for the localized variations in light emission across the display panel, leading to predictable but uncorrected image warping.

The parallax generating element, which may be a lenticular screen, has lenses whose refractive power varies across their width. This variation is tailored to compensate for the way the sub-pixel arrangement and black matrix affect the light paths. For example, the refractive power can be adjusted to be different at the center of a lens compared to its edges, or it can be varied asymmetrically. This allows for a more precise mapping of the light from the sub-pixels to the desired viewing zones, effectively pre-correcting for the distortion that would otherwise occur.

The result is a significant reduction in visible deformation of the projected views. Straight lines appear straight, and the overall geometric integrity of the 3D image is preserved. This approach also helps to suppress the Moiré effect by disrupting the periodic interference between the pixel grid and the parallax element. The non-uniformity can be implemented in various ways, such as by shaping the surface of the lenticules or by using materials with a gradient refractive index. The invention allows for the creation of higher-quality autostereoscopic displays that provide a more comfortable and immersive 3D experience.

## Detailed Description

### System Architecture

The autostereoscopic display device comprises a display panel, typically an LCD, and a parallax generating element. The display panel has a two-dimensional array of pixels, with each pixel comprising a plurality of sub-pixels (e.g., red, green, and blue). A black matrix, which is an opaque grid, surrounds the sub-pixels to prevent light leakage and improve contrast.

The parallax generating element is positioned over the display panel. In a preferred embodiment, this element is a lenticular screen made up of an array of elongate, parallel lenticules. These lenticules are cylindrical lenses that direct light from the columns of sub-pixels into different viewing zones in front of the display. The number of views generated corresponds to the number of sub-pixel columns that are covered by the pitch of one lenticule.

### Non-Uniform Refractive Power

The key feature of the invention is that the parallax generating element has a non-uniform refractive power. This means that the focal length of the lenticules is not constant across their aperture. The variation in refractive power is designed to counteract the optical distortion caused by the discrete and structured nature of the light sources (the sub-pixels) and the gaps between them (the black matrix).

The distortion arises because a uniform lens array maps the periodic pattern of the sub-pixels and black matrix into the viewing space, causing a non-linear relationship between the pixel position and the perceived viewing angle. This results in geometric distortion of the image. To correct this, the refractive power of the lenticules is modulated. For instance, the curvature of the lenticule surface can be designed to be non-circular, such as parabolic or aspheric.

In one embodiment, the refractive power is a function of the transverse position across the lenticule. The function can be symmetric or asymmetric. An asymmetric profile can be used to correct for distortions that are not symmetric with respect to the center of the lenticule. The specific profile of the refractive power variation is determined based on the geometry of the pixel array, including the size of the sub-pixels, the width of the black matrix lines, and the distance between the display panel and the parallax element.

### Implementation and Effects

The non-uniform refractive power can be achieved by physically shaping the lenticules. For example, instead of having a constant radius of curvature, the lenticules can have a profile described by a polynomial function. This allows for fine control over the refraction of light at different points across the lenticule.

By implementing this non-uniformity, the mapping from the sub-pixels to the viewing zones can be made more linear, which corrects the geometric distortion. A viewer looking at the display will perceive straight lines as straight, and the overall 3D image will appear more natural and less distorted. This correction also has the beneficial side effect of reducing the visibility of Moiré patterns, as the non-uniformity breaks the strict periodicity that leads to such interference effects. The design of the non-uniform profile requires careful optical modeling of the entire display system, taking into account the specific layout of the sub-pixels and the desired viewing geometry.
