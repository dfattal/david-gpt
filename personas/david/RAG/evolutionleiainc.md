## 2014: From HP Labs to Spin-Out

### Origins at HP Labs – 2013 Discovery
During a fire drill in 2010, engineers David Fattal and Zhen Peng noticed that diffractive patterns on a screen created a light-field effect. They experimented with this phenomenon, and by 2013 they had built prototypes demonstrating how diffractive backlighting could deliver 3D holographic images. Their work was published in the journal *Nature*, proving the viability of a light-field display.

### Founding of Leia Inc. (2014)
Fattal and Peng teamed up with Pierre-Emmanuel Evreux to commercialise the technology. They spun the project out of HP Labs in 2014, naming it Leia Inc. The company's goal was to license its light-field display hardware and build a software platform for glasses-free 3D experiences. The new venture established headquarters in Menlo Park, California, and began raising capital to develop prototypes.

## 2015-2016: Building Partnerships and Software Ecosystem

### Altice Partnership (May 2016)
Leia signed a strategic agreement with European telecom operator Altice to develop and distribute a 3D holographic smartphone across Altice's markets by late 2017. The press release noted that Altice would help market the device in France, Belgium, Israel, and Portugal. This collaboration was important because it showed carrier interest in Leia's technology.

### Creation of LeiaLoft (2016)
To complement its hardware, Leia established a software branch called LeiaLoft to develop and distribute light-field content. According to a CEO interview, this branch built tools and apps such as Holopix and Aura, enabling creators to produce and share 3D content. Building a content ecosystem would prove essential for later consumer products.

## 2017-2018: RED Partnership and Hydrogen One Phone

### RED Digital Cinema Alliance (Sept 2017)
Leia partnered with RED Digital Cinema to embed its light-field display into RED's upcoming Hydrogen One smartphone. RED's founder Jim Jannard invested in Leia and joined its board. Fattal highlighted that combining RED's imaging expertise with Leia's display would deliver a holographic experience. The phone was slated for release in 2018.

### Public Excitement and Pre-orders
Media outlets explained how the diffractive backlighting works, with the Hydrogen One promising 3D visuals without glasses and early-bird pre-orders for $1,195. Although the device eventually launched later in 2018 to mixed reviews, it validated Leia's ability to ship hardware at scale.

## 2019: Automotive Moves

### Continental Partnership
Automotive supplier Continental announced it was working with Leia on a Natural 3D Lightfield Instrument Cluster for car dashboards. The system created multiple viewing perspectives, making icons appear closer or farther away and improving depth perception. Continental said the technology would improve safety and allow developers to build holographic apps for vehicles. This partnership illustrated Leia's ambition beyond mobile.

## 2020-2021: The First Consumer Tablet

### Lume Pad Launch (Aug 2021)
After shipping development kits and building a content library, Leia released the Lume Pad, marketed as the world's first 3D light-field tablet. The 10.8-inch Android device projected images and video in 3D, converted 2D content in real time, and cost USD 649. Leia partnered with educational platform Mozaik and game publisher Gameloft to provide content. This marked Leia's first mass-market product and showed that the company could scale beyond niche devices.

## 2022-2023: AI and a Bigger Vision

### Lume Pad 2 (Feb 28 2023)
Leia announced the Lume Pad 2, calling it the world's first “3D • AI” tablet. The 12.4-inch screen offered 2560×1600 resolution and 120 Hz refresh, with AI that tracks the user's face to deliver correct perspectives and converts 2D images to 3D in real time. The device also included 5K stereoscopic cameras for capturing 3D photos and apps such as LeiaPlayer, LeiaCam, LeiaChat, and LeiaDream. The integration of AI signalled a shift toward smarter experiences.

### Acquisition of Dimenco (Aug 7 2023)
Leia acquired Dutch 3D-display pioneer Dimenco. The press release explained that Leia specialised in Android/mobile and automotive markets while Dimenco focused on Windows laptops and monitors. Uniting the companies would create a standardised 3D platform across smartphones, tablets, laptops, and monitors and bring Dimenco CEO Maarten Tobias in as Leia's chief commercial officer. This merger consolidated two major players and expanded Leia's portfolio.

### The New Vision
In a Q&A following the acquisition, Fattal and Tobias described improvements in 3D quality, the role of generative AI, and the importance of eye-tracking. They noted that working together would accelerate mainstream adoption and create industry standards. The 2023 news emphasised that 3D was no longer a gimmick but an emerging medium.

## 2024: Leadership Change and Immersity AI Platform

### New CEO (Jan 2024)
Leia hired Fabio Esposito—formerly of lens manufacturer Luxexcel—as chief executive, while David Fattal moved to the role of CTO. The announcement highlighted the company's growth, acquisition of Dimenco and Philips' 3D patent portfolio, and the plan to scale immersive experiences. Fattal said the world was entering a "renaissance of immersive experiences,” and Esposito planned to grow Leia's customer base.

### CES Highlights and Industry Momentum (Jan 2024)
In a company blog summarising early 2024, Leia showcased an 8K 3D panel for gaming (SR Pro 2) and teased a forthcoming 3D OLED smartphone. Leia announced an update to LeiaPix (now Immersity AI) that converts 2D videos to 3D and recounted events in New York and at the BETT education show in London. The blog signalled increased industry interest and readiness for 3D experiences.

### Immersity AI and 2D-to-3D Video (June 1 2024)
Leia relaunched its LeiaPix community as Immersity AI, an online platform powered by its Neural Depth Engine that transforms images and videos into 3D. By mid-2024 the platform had 3 million users and added a tool for converting 2D videos to 3D, enabling VR creators to share immersive content for headsets like Meta Quest 3 and Apple Vision Pro.

### Nubia Pad 3D II (Feb 26 2024)
ZTE's Nubia Pad 3D II integrated LeiaSR technology, boosting 3D resolution by 80%, doubling brightness and reducing cross-talk five-fold compared with previous versions. The release noted partnerships with NVIDIA and Intel and said the device would launch across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Leia declared the product its eighth major device, underlining growing adoption.

## 2025: Immersity Platform and Mobile App

### MWC 2025 Highlights (March 14 2025)
At Mobile World Congress 2025, Leia demonstrated its 3D displays and AI depth-mapping tools. Chief Strategy Officer Guido Groet emphasised the synergy between AI and 5G-Advanced networks to deliver immersive experiences, and partners such as China Mobile, Qualcomm, and ZTE supported the demonstration. Orange's CEO even captured her first 3D selfie using a Leia-powered ZTE tablet. The presence of major carriers signalled mainstream appeal.

### Immersity Mobile App (July 8 2025)
Leia launched the Immersity mobile app for iOS and Android. The app lets users convert photos into depth-rich videos using the Neural Depth Engine. The basic version is free with a watermark, while paid tiers allow 4K exports and commercial usage. The release emphasised easy sharing on social media and encouraged creative storytelling.

### Immersity Platform Launch (Aug 13 2025)
The company officially launched the Immersity platform and consolidated its products under the new brand. The platform combines advanced optical displays with AI depth-mapping and real-time face prediction to enable immersive experiences on any device. Leia declared that orders for the Lume Pad 2 would end on Aug 18 2025 with support ending Aug 17 2026, signifying a shift away from standalone tablets to a service-oriented ecosystem. This move marks the beginning of the next era—software-centric 3D experiences delivered on multiple hardware platforms.

## Summary
From its origins in HP Labs, Leia Inc. has evolved from a science project into a company building an ecosystem for glasses-free 3D displays. Its early years focused on licensing its light-field hardware and forging partnerships with carriers and device makers. After shipping its first consumer products (Hydrogen One and Lume Pad), Leia expanded into automotive and consolidated its operations by acquiring Dimenco. The company then embraced AI, launching the Lume Pad 2, the Immersity AI platform and the Immersity mobile app. By 2025 Leia is transitioning from selling tablets to offering a cross-device platform that converts 2D content into immersive 3D experiences. The journey shows steady growth, strong partnerships and a shift toward software and AI as the drivers of the next generation of 3D computing.
