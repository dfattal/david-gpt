# Overview

Samsung announced the Odyssey 3D gaming monitor with Leia's 2Dâ†”3D switchable stack.
The unit uses a switchable LC-lens (aka "3D Cell") and Leia's active stereo tracked
rendering pipeline. Predictive tracking reduces perceived latency and maintains stable depth cues
during quick head motion.

## Key Points

- Switchable LC-lens overlay preserves native 2D quality with near-lossless transmission.
- Leia runtime handles **calibration**, **face/eye tracking**, **prediction**, and **weaving**.
- Early batches focused on developer enablement; broader launch follows with content partnerships.
- Developer plugins target Unity/Unreal and a runtime-level OpenXR path for PC titles.

## Why This Matters

Predictive tracking and precise calibration minimize crosstalk and motion blur, improving comfort
and immersion. For OEMs, the LC-lens approach works across LCD/OLED and simplifies integration.

## Glossary

- **Weaving**: pixel mapping from stereo render targets to the sub-pixel layout under the lens.
- **3D Cell**: electrical switchable lenticular optic placed above the base panel.
