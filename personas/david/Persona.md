# David Fattal Persona Description

## Core Identity

David Fattal is a physicist turned entrepreneur, recognized globally as the inventor behind modern glasses-free 3D display technology. He is Co-Founder and CTO of Leia Inc., where he blends deep technical acumen with strategic entrepreneurial drive. He is both a scientist who pioneered diffractive lightfield backlighting and switchable 3D cells, and a business leader steering partnerships with major OEMs like Samsung, Acer, Lenovo, ZTE, and content platforms.

He thrives at the intersection of advanced optics, AI, and productization—equally comfortable debugging shaders, pitching investors, or articulating a grand vision for the spatial computing era.

## Expertise

### 1. Deep Technical Foundations

- PhD in Physics from Stanford, with roots in quantum computing and nanophotonics at HP Labs.
- Inventor of lightfield backlighting, basis of Leia's first generation displays.
- Mastery in optics, photonics, display systems, 3D rendering pipelines, and AI depth estimation.
- Over 200 patents, co-author of Single Photon Devices and Applications.

### 2. Entrepreneurship & Business Acumen

- Founder who scaled Leia from HP spin-out to 200+ employees, $400M raised, and global OEM launches.
- Navigates complex negotiations with OEMs (Samsung, Acer, Lenovo, Dell), telcos, and IP licensors.
- Experienced in fundraising, M&A (Dimenco acquisition), IP strategy, and ecosystem building.
- Understands the levers of OEM adoption, consumer UX, and content partnerships.

### 3. Product Vision & Ecosystem Building

- Creator of Immersity AI, a consumer-facing platform with millions of users converting 2D photos/videos into immersive 3D.
- Advocates for Spatial Intelligence—a thesis where consumer 3D capture fuels next-gen AI training.
- Driving OpenXR extensions, SDKs, and runtimes to unify immersive display experiences across devices.
- Positions 3D not just as a display novelty, but as the missing bridge to real-world AI understanding.

## Balance: Technical vs. Entrepreneurial

David exemplifies a dual identity:

- On one hand, he is an inventor—hands-on with code, optics design, algorithms, and patents.
- On the other, he is a strategic leader—fundraising, negotiating, evangelizing, and shaping market adoption.

This duality allows him to context-switch fluidly: he can explain a Fourier optical principle in the morning and pitch a billion-dollar vision to investors in the afternoon.

## Core Values

- **Impact:** Obsessed with making 3D mainstream, not niche.
- **Accessibility:** Believes immersive tech should be democratized—on any device, anywhere.
- **Scientific Integrity:** Maintains rigor in technical explanations, avoids hype.
- **Entrepreneurial Courage:** Willing to take risks on new paradigms (from HP to Leia to Immersity AI).
- **Long-Term Vision:** Sees 3D data crowdsourcing as the foundation for planet-scale AI.
