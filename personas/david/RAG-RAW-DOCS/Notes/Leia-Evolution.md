# Evolution of Leia Inc. (2014–2025)

## 2014: From HP Labs to Spin‑Out

-   **Origins at HP Labs – 2013 discovery:** During a fire drill in 2010, engineers David Fattal and Zhen Peng noticed that diffractive patterns on a screen created a light‑field effect. They experimented with this phenomenon, and by 2013 they had built prototypes demonstrating how diffractive backlighting could deliver 3D holographic images. Their work was published in the journal Nature, proving the viability of a light‑field display.

-   **Founding of Leia Inc. (2014):** Fattal and Peng teamed up with Pierre‑Emmanuel Evreux to commercialise the technology. They spun the project out of HP Labs in 2014, naming it Leia Inc. The company’s goal was to license its light‑field display hardware and build a software platform for glasses‑free 3D experiences. The new venture established headquarters in Menlo Park, California, and began raising capital to develop prototypes.

## 2015–2016: Building Partnerships and Software Ecosystem

-   **Altice partnership (May 2016):** Leia signed a strategic agreement with European telecom operator Altice to develop and distribute a 3D holographic smartphone across Altice’s markets by late 2017. The press release noted that Altice would help market the device in France, Belgium, Israel and Portugal. The collaboration was important because it showed carrier interest in Leia’s technology.

-   **Creation of LeiaLoft (2016):** To complement its hardware, Leia established a software branch called LeiaLoft to develop and distribute light‑field content. According to a CEO interview, this branch built tools and apps such as Holopix and Aura, enabling creators to produce and share 3D content. Building a content ecosystem would prove essential for later consumer products.

## 2017–2018: RED Partnership and Hydrogen One Phone

-   **RED Digital Cinema alliance (Sept 2017):** Leia partnered with RED Digital Cinema to embed its light‑field display into RED’s upcoming Hydrogen One smartphone. RED’s founder Jim Jannard invested in Leia and joined its board. Fattal highlighted that combining RED’s imaging expertise with Leia’s display would deliver a holographic experience. The phone was slated for release in 2018.

-   **Public excitement and pre‑orders:** Media outlets explained how the diffractive backlighting works, with the Hydrogen One promising 3D visuals without glasses and early‑bird pre‑orders for $1,195. Although the device eventually launched later in 2018 to mixed reviews, it validated Leia’s ability to ship hardware at scale.

## 2019: Automotive Moves

-   **Continental partnership:** Automotive supplier Continental announced it was working with Leia on a Natural 3D Lightfield Instrument Cluster for car dashboards. The system created multiple viewing perspectives, making icons appear closer or farther away and improving depth perception. Continental said the technology would improve safety and allow developers to build holographic apps for vehicles. The partnership illustrated Leia’s ambition beyond mobile.

## Summary

From its origins in HP Labs, Leia Inc. has evolved from a science project into a company building an ecosystem for glasses‑free 3D displays. Its early years focused on licensing its light‑field hardware and forging partnerships with carriers and device makers. After shipping its first consumer products (Hydrogen One and Lume Pad), Leia expanded into automotive and consolidated its operations by acquiring Dimenco. The company then embraced AI, launching the Lume Pad 2, the Immersity AI platform and the Immersity mobile app. By 2025 Leia is transitioning from selling tablets to offering a cross‑device platform that converts 2D content into immersive 3D experiences. The journey shows steady growth, strong partnerships and a shift toward software and AI as the drivers of the next generation of 3D computing.
