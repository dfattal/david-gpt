## Abstract
Multibeam diffraction grating-based backlighting includes a light guide and a multibeam diffraction grating at a surface of the light guide. The light guide is configured to guide light from a light source. The multibeam diffraction grating is configured to couple out a portion of the guided light using diffractive coupling and to direct the diffractively coupled out portion away from the light guide as a plurality of light beams with different principal angular directions having directions corresponding to view directions of a multiview display.

## Background
Electronic displays are a nearly ubiquitous medium for communicating information to users of a wide variety of devices and products. Among the most commonly found electronic displays are the cathode ray tube (CRT), plasma display panels (PDP), liquid crystal displays (LCD), electroluminescent displays (EL), organic light emitting diode (OLED) and active matrix OLEDs (AMOLED) displays, electrophoretic displays (EP) and various displays that employ electromechanical or electrofluidic light modulation (e.g., digital micromirror devices, electrowetting displays, etc.). In general, electronic displays may be categorized as either active displays (i.e., displays that emit light) or passive displays (i.e., displays that modulate light provided by another source). Among the most obvious examples of active displays are CRTs, PDPs and OLEDs/AMOLEDs. Displays that are typically classified as passive when considering emitted light are LCDs and EP displays. Passive displays, while often exhibiting attractive performance characteristics including, but not limited to, inherently low power consumption, may find somewhat limited use in many practical applications given the lack of an ability to emit light.

To overcome the applicability limitations of passive displays associated with emitted light, many passive displays are coupled to an external light source. The coupled light source may allow these otherwise passive displays to emit light and function substantially as an active display. Examples of such coupled light sources are backlights. Backlights are light sources (often panel light sources) that are placed behind an otherwise passive display to illuminate the passive display. For example, a backlight may be coupled to an LCD or an EP display. The backlight emits light that passes through the LCD or the EP display. The light emitted is modulated by the LCD or the EP display and the modulated light is then emitted, in turn, from the LCD or the EP display. Often backlights are configured to emit white light. Color filters are then used to transform the white light into various colors used in the display. The color filters may be placed at an output of the LCD or the EP display (less common) or between the backlight and the LCD or the EP display, for example.

## Detailed Description
Examples in accordance with the principles described herein provide multiview electronic display backlighting using multibeam diffractive coupling. In particular, backlighting of an electronic display described herein employs a multibeam diffraction grating. The multibeam diffraction grating is used to couple light out of a light guide and to direct the coupled out light in a viewing direction of the multiview electronic display. The coupled out light directed in the viewing direction by the multibeam diffraction grating includes a plurality of light beams that have different principal angular directions from one another, according to various examples of the principles described herein. In some examples, the light beams having the different principal angular directions (also referred to as 'the differently directed light beams') may be employed to display three-dimensional (3D) information. For example, the differently directed light beams produced by the multibeam diffraction grating may be modulated and serve as pixels of a 'glasses free' multiview electronic display, for example.

According to various examples, the multibeam diffraction grating produces the plurality of light beams having a corresponding plurality of different, spatially separated angles (i.e., different principal angular directions). In particular, each light beam produced by the multibeam diffraction grating has a principal angular direction given by angular components {θ, φ}. The angular component θ is referred to herein as the 'elevation component' or 'elevation angle' of the light beam. The angular component φ is referred to as the 'azimuth component' or 'azimuth angle' of the light beam, herein. By definition, the elevation angle θ is an angle in a vertical plane (e.g., perpendicular to a plane of the multibeam diffraction grating) while the azimuth angle φ is an angle in a horizontal plane (e.g., parallel to the multibeam diffraction grating plane).
