## Technical Implementation Path

### 1. Admin Route Structure
```
src/app/admin/
├── layout.tsx          # Admin-only layout with navigation
├── page.tsx            # Admin dashboard overview
├── documents/          # Document ingestion management
│   ├── upload/         # File upload interface
│   ├── processing/     # Processing status monitoring
│   └── library/        # Document library management
├── knowledge-graph/    # KG management tools
│   ├── entities/       # Entity browser and editor
│   ├── relationships/ # Relationship management
│   └── validation/     # Data quality tools
└── users/             # User management interface
```

### 2. API Extensions Needed
```

├── relationships/      # KG relationship operations
├── users/             # User management operations
└── system/            # System monitoring and health
```

### 3. Component Extensions
```
src/components/admin/
├── DocumentUpload/     # File upload with progress
├── EntityManager/      # Entity CRUD interface
├── RelationshipEditor/ # Relationship management
├── UserDirectory/      # User management interface
└── SystemHealth/       # Performance monitoring
```

## Risk Assessment: LOW RISK

### ✅ Strengths
- **Solid Foundation**: All infrastructure components operational
