**Updated By:** Full-Stack Production Agent

## Component Integration Map

### RAG System Status
- **Document Processing**: 🟡 Framework implemented, needs integration with working tools
- **Embeddings Pipeline**: 🟡 OpenAI integration ready, not operational in chat
- **Hybrid Search**: 🟡 Framework exists, causes streaming conflicts when enabled
- **Knowledge Graph**: 🟡 Mini-KG schema ready, tools disabled due to streaming issues
- **Citations System**: 🟡 Framework exists, not functional due to disabled RAG tools
- **CRITICAL ISSUE**: All RAG tools cause streaming responses to hang completely

### API Layer Status  
- **Chat Endpoints**: 🟡 Basic streaming working, RAG tools disabled due to conflicts
- **Document Upload**: 🟡 Framework ready, needs ingestion workflow
- **Admin APIs**: ❌ Not implemented
- **Authentication**: ✅ Integrated with role-based access (admin/member/guest)

### Frontend Status
- **Chat Interface**: ✅ Production-ready with real-time features (AI SDK v5 streaming + SSE)
- **Real-Time Updates**: ✅ SSE-powered title generation with React Strict Mode compatibility  
- **Production UX**: ✅ Loading states, toast notifications, responsive design, error handling
- **Document Management**: ❌ Not implemented
- **Admin Dashboard**: ❌ Not implemented
- **User Authentication**: ✅ Implemented with Google OAuth and user avatars

### Production Readiness Status
- **Real-Time Infrastructure**: ✅ SSE with React Strict Mode + HMR compatibility
- **Error Handling**: ✅ Toast notifications with graceful failure recovery
- **Loading States**: ✅ Professional spinners and skeleton UI
- **Responsive Design**: ✅ Mobile-first with adaptive sidebar (w-64/w-72/w-80)
- **UX Polish**: ✅ Smooth animations, optimized spacing, user feedback
- **Development Stability**: ✅ HMR-resistant architecture for reliable development
- **Performance**: ✅ Optimized re-renders, efficient state management
- **Accessibility**: ✅ Screen reader support, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels

## Critical Integration Points

### Database Schema
- **Tables**: ✅ Complete - 13 tables created (mini-KG + conversation + RAG infrastructure)
- **Migrations**: ✅ Applied - Full schema with indexes, constraints, triggers
- **RLS Policies**: ✅ Implemented - Role-based access control for multi-tenant security
- **Performance**: ✅ Optimized - HNSW vector indexes, GIN text search, comprehensive indexing

### External Services
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: ✅ Working for basic chat, RAG integration blocked by tools issue
- **Cohere Rerank**: 🟡 Integration exists but not operational due to disabled tools
- **GROBID**: 🟡 Public API integration ready but not connected to chat

## Dependencies
- ✅ **Database Foundation**: Schema established and fully integrated with RAG pipeline
- ✅ **Production Chat**: AI SDK v5 streaming with David's persona and real-time features
- ✅ **Frontend**: Complete production-ready chat interface with authentication and UX polish
- ✅ **Real-Time Infrastructure**: SSE system with React Strict Mode and HMR compatibility
- ✅ **Production UX**: Error handling, loading states, responsive design, accessibility
- 🟡 **RAG Integration**: Tools framework ready but streaming conflicts need resolution
- **Critical Blocker**: RAG tools cause streaming to hang - needs investigation
- **Next Critical Path**: Fix RAG tools + streaming compatibility, then document ingestion

## RAG Integration Status (2025-01-03) - NOT OPERATIONAL

### Framework Components Built:
1. **Hybrid Search Pipeline**: ⚠️ Framework exists but disabled due to streaming conflicts
2. **Citation System**: ⚠️ [A1], [B2] format built but not functional  
3. **Multi-Turn Context**: ⚠️ Smart source carry-over logic exists but unused
4. **Knowledge Graph Queries**: ⚠️ Entity/timeline search built but not working
5. **Chat API Integration**: ❌ Tool calling causes streaming to hang completely
6. **Error Handling**: ❌ Not tested due to non-functional tools
7. **Database Persistence**: ✅ Schema ready, not used by disabled tools

### Critical Blocking Issue:
- **AI SDK v5 + Tools + Streaming**: Any tool (simple or complex) causes streaming responses to hang
- **Impact**: RAG pipeline completely non-functional in chat interface
- **Status**: Framework exists but cannot be used until streaming conflict is resolved

### Current State: ❌ RAG PIPELINE NOT OPERATIONAL
The RAG framework exists but is completely disabled. Basic chat works perfectly, but all RAG functionality is blocked by the tools+streaming compatibility issue that needs investigation and resolution.
