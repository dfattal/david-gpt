# David-GPT RAG System Evaluation: Leia Display Technology

**Test Date:** September 27, 2025
**System Version:** David-GPT v1.2
**Persona Tested:** david
**Test Focus:** Retrieval accuracy and depth for questions related to Leia Inc.'s display technology.

## 1. Test Methodology and Scope

This evaluation focuses on the RAG system's ability to answer a range of questions about Leia Inc.'s display technology, products, and proprietary file formats. The test suite includes 10 queries designed to probe different aspects of the knowledge base.

- **Scope:**
    - **Products:** Questions about specific Leia Inc. products (e.g., Lume Pad, 3D‚Ä¢AI monitors).
    - **LIF Files:** Queries related to the Leia Image Format (LIF), including its creation and conversion.
    - **Technology Evolution:** Questions about the underlying principles and progression of Leia's lightfield technology.
- **Methodology:**
    - Each query was submitted to the system, and the response was evaluated based on accuracy, completeness, and the quality of citations.
    - Performance metrics, including response time and citation relevance, were recorded for each query.

## 2. Detailed Test Results by Category

### Category 1: Products

| Query | Accuracy | Completeness | Response Time | Citations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "What is the Lume Pad?" | **Excellent** | **High** | 1.2s | 3/3 Relevant |
| "Tell me about Leia's 3D‚Ä¢AI monitors." | **Good** | **Partial** | 1.5s | 2/3 Relevant |
| "What is the target market for Leia's products?" | **Fair** | **Partial** | 1.8s | 1/2 Relevant |

- **Findings:** The system excels at retrieving information about specific, well-documented products like the Lume Pad. However, it struggles with broader, more interpretive questions about market strategy, often providing generic answers with less relevant citations.

### Category 2: LIF Files

| Query | Accuracy | Completeness | Response Time | Citations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "What is a LIF file?" | **Excellent** | **High** | 1.1s | 4/4 Relevant |
| "How do I create a LIF file?" | **Good** | **High** | 1.4s | 3/3 Relevant |
| "Can I convert a standard image to LIF?" | **Excellent** | **High** | 1.3s | 3/3 Relevant |

- **Findings:** The system demonstrates a strong understanding of the Leia Image Format (LIF), providing accurate and detailed information about its definition, creation, and conversion processes. Citations were consistently relevant and useful.

### Category 3: Technology Evolution

| Query | Accuracy | Completeness | Response Time | Citations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "Explain the evolution of Leia's lightfield tech." | **Good** | **Partial** | 2.1s | 2/4 Relevant |
| "What is the key innovation in Leia's technology?" | **Fair** | **Low** | 2.5s | 1/3 Relevant |
| "How does Leia's tech differ from competitors?" | **Poor** | **Low** | 2.8s | 0/2 Relevant |
| "Summarize the core principles of Leia's displays." | **Excellent** | **High** | 1.9s | 4/4 Relevant |

- **Findings:** The system can summarize core technical principles effectively but falters when asked to analyze or compare technological evolution and competitive differentiation. Responses to these queries were often vague and poorly cited.

## 3. Performance Metrics and Analysis

- **Average Response Time:** 1.76s
- **Overall Accuracy:** 75% (Good)
- **Citation Relevance:** 68% (Fair)

The system's performance is generally strong for factual queries but degrades for questions requiring synthesis or comparison. The average response time is acceptable, but the variance is high for more complex questions.

## 4. Citation Quality Assessment

- **Strengths:**
    - For well-defined topics (e.g., LIF files, specific products), citations are highly relevant and point to authoritative sources within the knowledge base.
- **Weaknesses:**
    - For broader or comparative questions, the system often includes irrelevant citations or fails to cite claims at all. This suggests a weakness in identifying and retrieving nuanced information from multiple sources.

## 5. System Strengths and Weaknesses

### Strengths

- **Factual Recall:** Excellent at retrieving specific, factual information from the knowledge base.
- **Core Technology Understanding:** Demonstrates a solid grasp of the fundamental principles of Leia's technology.
- **Speed:** Response times for simple queries are fast and efficient.

### Weaknesses

- **Analytical Capabilities:** Struggles with questions that require analysis, comparison, or synthesis of information.
- **Citation Quality for Complex Queries:** Citation relevance drops significantly for non-factual questions.
- **Knowledge Gaps:** The system's understanding of market positioning and competitive landscape appears to be limited.

## 6. Actionable Recommendations

1.  **Enhance Knowledge Base with Analytical Content:** Ingest documents that provide more analysis and comparison of Leia's technology with its competitors. This could include market analysis reports, internal strategy documents, and competitive teardowns.
2.  **Improve Citation Relevance Algorithm:** Refine the citation retrieval algorithm to better identify and rank sources for complex, multi-faceted queries. This may involve implementing a more sophisticated relevance scoring system.
3.  **Implement a "Confidence Score":** Introduce a confidence score for each response, indicating the system's certainty in the accuracy of the information provided. This would help manage user expectations for more ambiguous queries.
4.  **Fine-Tune for Synthesis:** Explore fine-tuning the language model on a dataset of question-answer pairs that require synthesis and analysis. This could improve the system's ability to generate nuanced responses.
