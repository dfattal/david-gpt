## 4. Multi-Turn Conversation Context Management Tests

This section outlines test cases for evaluating the RAG system's ability to manage context across multiple turns in a conversation. These tests are crucial for ensuring the chatbot feels natural and intelligent.

### Testing Procedure

These tests should be executed by sending a series of requests to the `/api/chat` endpoint. Each request in a scenario builds upon the previous one, simulating a conversation. The JSON payload for the request must include the entire conversation history in the `messages` array to provide context to the model.

**API Endpoint:** `/api/chat`
**Method:** `POST`
**Headers:** `Content-Type: application/json`

**Example `curl` command for a multi-turn scenario:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d 
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What is Diffractive Lightfield Backlighting?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Diffractive Lightfield Backlighting (DLB) is a technology that uses a nanostructured backlight to direct light in specific directions, creating a 3D effect."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What were its main limitations?"
    }
  ],
  "persona": "david"
}
```

### 4.1. Conversation Continuity Tests

**Objective:** To ensure the system can maintain context within a single, continuous topic of conversation, using pronouns and follow-up questions correctly.

**Scenario 1: Exploring a Single Technology**

*   **Conversation Steps:**
    1.  **User:** "Tell me about Leia's Diffractive Lightfield Backlighting technology."
    2.  **Assistant:** (Responds with a detailed explanation of DLB).
    3.  **User:** "What were its primary drawbacks?"
    4.  **Assistant:** (Responds with the limitations of DLB, such as brightness and resolution).
    5.  **User:** "Which products used it?"
    6.  **Assistant:** (Lists products like the RED Hydrogen One).

*   **Evaluation Criteria:**
    *   The assistant must understand that "its" in step 3 refers to DLB.
    *   The assistant must understand that "it" in step 5 refers to DLB.
    *   Each response should build upon the previous one without needing the user to restate the topic.
    *   The information provided should be accurate and relevant to the specific questions.

### 4.2. Context Switching Detection

**Objective:** To test the system's ability to recognize when a user has changed the subject and begin a new line of inquiry without being influenced by the previous context.

**Scenario 2: Abrupt Topic Change**

*   **Conversation Steps:**
    1.  **User:** "What is a LIF file?"
    2.  **Assistant:** (Explains the Leia Image Format).
    3.  **User:** "How does it store 3D data?"
    4.  **Assistant:** (Explains the use of depth maps or multiple views).
    5.  **User:** "Okay, now tell me about the history of Supabase."
    6.  **Assistant:** (Responds with information about Supabase's founding, purpose, etc., without mentioning LIF files or Leia).

*   **Evaluation Criteria:**
    *   The assistant's response in step 6 should be entirely focused on Supabase.
    *   There should be no "context bleed" from the previous topic (LIF files). The model should not try to find a connection between LIF files and Supabase.
    *   The system should effectively "reset" the context for the new topic.

### 4.3. Related vs. Unrelated Query Routing

**Objective:** To evaluate how the system handles queries that are related to the current topic but distinct, versus queries that are completely unrelated.

**Scenario 3: Topic Drift**

*   **Conversation Steps:**
    1.  **User:** "What are the main components of Leia's switchable LC display technology?"
    2.  **Assistant:** (Describes the LC layer, driving electronics, etc.).
    3.  **User:** "How does that compare to conventional parallax barrier displays?" (Related Query)
    4.  **Assistant:** (Provides a comparison of the two technologies, highlighting differences in brightness, viewing angles, and mechanism).
    5.  **User:** "What's the best way to cook a steak?" (Unrelated Query)
    6.  **Assistant:** (Provides instructions for cooking steak, without any reference to display technology).

*   **Evaluation Criteria:**
    *   For the related query (step 3), the system should access its general knowledge while keeping the context of Leia's technology to form a comparison.
    *   For the unrelated query (step 5), the system should completely switch context and not attempt to relate steak to display technology.
    *   The system should demonstrate an ability to differentiate between a topic expansion and a complete topic change.

### 4.4. Context Window Management

**Objective:** To test the system's behavior as the conversation history grows and approaches the context window limit.

**Scenario 4: Long Conversation and Summarization**

*   **Note:** This test assumes a hypothetical context window limit. The goal is to observe behavior, not to define a hard limit.

*   **Conversation Steps:**
    1.  **User:** (Initiates a long, multi-turn conversation about various aspects of Leia's technology, covering DLB, LC displays, LIF files, and specific products over 10-15 exchanges).
    2.  ... (Many turns of conversation) ...
    3.  **User:** "Based on everything we've discussed, what would you say are the three most significant innovations from Leia Inc.?"

*   **Expected Behavior:**
    *   The system should be able to synthesize information from across the entire conversation history to answer the final question.
    *   The response should accurately summarize the key points discussed (e.g., the shift from DLB to LC, the development of real-time 2D-to-3D conversion, and the LIF format).
    *   If the context window is exceeded, the system's response might become less coherent or lose track of earlier parts of the conversation. The test is to see *how* it handles this degradation. Does it gracefully summarize what it can remember, or does it fail completely?

*   **Evaluation Criteria:**
    *   The quality and accuracy of the summary in the final step.
    *   The ability of the system to maintain coherence and recall details from the beginning of the conversation.
    *   Observing any degradation in response quality as the conversation length increases, which can help in identifying the effective context window limit.

## 5. Automated Testing Scripts

To streamline the evaluation process, a set of executable scripts are provided to automate the single-turn and multi-turn tests outlined above.

### Script Location and Description

The primary testing scripts are located in the root directory and the `src/scripts/` directory.

*   **`run-rag-tests.sh`**: This is the main script for executing the comprehensive RAG test suite. It iterates through all 21 questions defined in this guide, sends them to the chat API, and records the responses in a markdown file.
*   **`run-multiturn-tests.sh`**: The dedicated script for multi-turn conversation testing. Implements all four test scenarios from Section 4, managing conversation history and context evaluation. Generates `multiturn-test-results.md`.
*   **`run-remaining-tests.sh`**: A utility script to run tests that may have been skipped or failed in a previous run.
*   **`src/scripts/run-optimized-rag-tests.ts`**: The core TypeScript script that handles the logic of sending requests to the API. It is called by the shell scripts.

## 6. Test Execution Commands

Follow these steps to run the automated tests.

### Prerequisites

1.  Ensure the application is running in development mode. If not, start it with:
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
2.  The test scripts target the local development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Running the Full Test Suite

To execute all 21 single-turn test cases:

```bash
sh run-rag-tests.sh
```

This command will create or overwrite the `rag-test-results.md` file in the root directory with the results of the test run.

### Running Multi-Turn Tests

#### Automated Multi-Turn Testing

To execute the complete multi-turn test suite automatically:

```bash
./run-multiturn-tests.sh
```

This script implements all four test scenarios from Section 4 and generates a comprehensive report at `multiturn-test-results.md`.

#### Manual Multi-Turn Testing

Multi-turn tests can also be executed manually using `curl` or a REST client to simulate conversation flows. Use the example `curl` command in Section 4 as a template.

**Manual Test Example:**
```bash
# First turn
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is DLB technology?"}],
    "conversationId": "test-manual-$(date +%s)",
    "persona": "david"
  }'

# Second turn (add previous response to messages array)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "What is DLB technology?"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "[Previous response here]"},
      {"role": "user", "content": "What were its main limitations?"}
    ],
    "conversationId": "test-manual-$(date +%s)",
    "persona": "david"
  }'
```

## 7. Result Analysis Procedures

After the automated test run is complete, the results require manual review to assess the quality of the RAG system's responses.

### Output Location and Format

*   **File**: `rag-test-results.md`
*   **Format**: The results are stored in a Markdown file. Each test case includes the question, the API response, and any citations provided. The file is structured for easy reading and analysis.

### Evaluation Checklist

Use the following checklist to evaluate each response in the `rag-test-results.md` file:

*   [ ] **Factual Accuracy**: Is the information provided correct and consistent with the source documents?
*   [ ] **Relevance**: Does the response directly and concisely answer the user's question?
*   [ ] **Completeness**: Does the answer address all parts of the question?
*   [ ] **Citation Presence & Relevance**: Are citations provided? Do they link to the correct source documents that support the answer?
*   [ ] **Clarity and Coherence**: Is the response well-written, free of jargon (unless appropriate), and easy to understand?
*   [ ] **Technical Depth**: Is the level of detail appropriate for the question?

### Documenting Outcomes

For each test, fill in the "Analysis" section provided in the report. Mark each criterion with a pass/fail or a qualitative score. Add notes for any responses that are particularly good or require improvement.

## 8. Integration with Existing Testing Framework

The RAG evaluation scripts are currently designed for standalone execution. However, they can be integrated into the project's existing testing frameworks (`Vitest` and `Playwright`) for more robust and automated validation.

### Current Frameworks

*   **Vitest**: Used for unit and integration testing of individual components and functions.
*   **Playwright**: Used for end-to-end (E2E) testing that simulates user interactions in a browser.

### Proposed Integration Strategy

1.  **Vitest for API-Level Testing**:
    *   The logic from `run-optimized-rag-tests.ts` can be wrapped into `it` blocks within a Vitest test file (e.g., `rag.test.ts`).
    *   This would allow for making API calls directly from the test runner.
    *   Assertions can be added to automatically check for response status codes, the presence of citations, or keywords in the response text.

2.  **Playwright for E2E User Simulation**:
    *   Playwright tests can be written to simulate a user typing questions into the chat interface.
    *   Assertions can then validate that the responses are displayed correctly in the UI.
    *   This approach is ideal for testing the full conversational flow, including multi-turn scenarios, from a user's perspective.

By integrating the RAG tests into these frameworks, we can build a more comprehensive and automated quality assurance process for the application.
