# Gamescom 2025: Samsung Odyssey Brings Fans Closer to the Games They Love

Samsung Electronics made a powerful return to Gamescom 2025, the world's largest computer and video game event, boasting a massive exhibition space filled with groundbreaking gaming monitors, TVs and immersive experiences.

Held from August 20-24 at Koelnmesse in Cologne, Germany, this year's Gamescom drew more than 350,000 fans from around the world eager to see the latest innovations in gaming. Celebrating its 10th year showcasing gaming monitors at the event, Samsung gave attendees a firsthand look at how Odyssey monitors provide the ultimate way to experience their favorite games, whether battling in competitive tournaments, exploring massive open worlds or diving into glasses-free 3D.

## Gaming on New 37" and 40" Odyssey Monitors

The centerpiece of Samsung's booth was its full Odyssey OLED lineup (27", 32" and 49"), along with the new large gaming monitors — the 37" and 40" Odyssey G7 (G75F). These large-screen displays deliver superb resolution and smooth, stutter-free gameplay with HDR10+ Gaming, AMD FreeSync™ Premium Pro and CoreSync backlight color-matching.

Fans were delighted by HoYoverse's Genshin Impact on the new monitors, praising the sharp visuals and expansive field of view. "It's definitely the perfect gadget to play Genshin Impact. It brings the characters and all the fighting to life," said character cosplayer Anne Gerbest(@the.lunatic.ghost). Another fan who played Genshin Impact with the Odyssey G7 pointed out its standout advantage as "the size". He said, "because you get so much from the picture on one monitor. I would recommend it to every gamer. G7 is my all-day gaming experience."

## Odyssey 3D Excites Players With New Partnership Expansions

Samsung also expanded its glasses-free Odyssey 3D gaming ecosystem with new content and partnerships. For the first time ever, attendees could play SHIFT UP's Stellar Blade and Netmarble's upcoming title, MONGIL: STAR DIVE, in 3D at the Samsung booth.

With Eye Tracking and View Mapping technology, Odyssey 3D adjusts depth effects for each character, background and scene. "This is definitely a brand-new gaming experience for me. The 3D makes the colors pop, and it pulls me into the scene," said a fan after trying Stellar Blade.

Visitors also praised the immersive quality of Odyssey 3D while playing MONGIL: STAR DIVE. "I think it's one of the best PC monitors I've played on," said fan George Osborn. "It's just so in-depth, during the battles, they come out of the monitor. It's just incredible."

Samsung also announced that the Odyssey 3D Hub will double its library from 28 to over 50 optimized 3D games by the end of the year, including Lies of P: Overture, Stellar Blade and MONGIL: STAR DIVE.

"It was my first time playing on the Samsung OLED. I've been playing World of Warcraft for fifteen years, and it's a really nice [new] feature, and the graphics are really great. I really liked it," noted Jenny Degreef, a World of Warcraft fan.
